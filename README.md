***Welcome to Pillon Engineering!***

**or Dozer engineering, or whatever I decide to call myself tomorrow!**

- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael
- 👀 I’m an electrical engineering student in my 3rd year.
- 🌱 I have an equal love for both software and hardware and my projects tend between C or C++ embedded and/or NodeJS web servers.
- 💞️ I'm an avid maker with years of 3D design and 3D printing experience and have recently got involved with DYI CNC.
- 📫 How to reach me ... that's a good question...
