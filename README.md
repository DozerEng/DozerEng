## ***Welcome to Pillon Engineering!***

Hi, I’m Mike, I’m an electrical engineering student in my 4th year at the University of Victoria.

On this page you can find some of the person projects I've worked on over the last few years. I started with building websites using vanilla Javascript and then started learning hardware. You'll find a lot of NodeJS fullstack projects (of varying quality!) which I run on various single board computers. I do a lot more embedded design these days and tend to use C or C++ to work with various microcontrollers, often on custom PCBSs. 

### Thanks for stopping by!
